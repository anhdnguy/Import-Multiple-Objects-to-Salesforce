# Import Contact, Opportunity, and a Custom Object

The Import Wizard only allows to import a single object per job. In order to save time, this class will help import records to multiple objects which are Contact, Opportunity, and a Custom Object called Integration Origin.

The Sales Representative will download the csv template on a Lightning Page called Import New Prospect which was built using Visualforce.

On the template, users will input the data. On the Import New Prospect, users can select the Close Date, Owner, and Record Type that apply to all of the record that they are going to import.

If the system import the record successfully, it will display the records along with their ids under the Successfully Imported Students section.
